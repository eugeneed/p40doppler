# Observing Doppler's Law by Simulating the Drop of a Whistling Projectile

This is my Physics 40 final.

In this project, I tried simulating the Doppler effect for a whistling projectile using two ways to find if I can make the sound effect of a bomb dropping in the movies. The two ways were generating the sound from the Doppler frequency and manipulating the sound directly. I used MoviePy and PyLab for the simulation, and found that one can achieve the appropriate sound effect by placing the observer at the release point of the projectile. I also learned how to use MoviePy as well as some techniques for speeding up Python code.
